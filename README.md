# Frozen Food

This is a gameplay mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studios

Frozen Food aims to add a bit more realism to the game by allowing food items to become frozen over time, like clothing items. If a food item is too frozen, it cannot be eaten.

* Frozen percentage on food items
* If a food item is more than 50% frozen, it cannot be consumed.
* If a food item is less than 50% frozen but more than 25% it will cause you to get slightly colder when consumed.
* Food items freeze and thaw based on temperature and item type. 
* Meat freezes the quickest, dry items like crackers freeze slower. 
* Items in containers and backpack will freeze slower, but also thaw slower. Items on the ground will freeze quicker and thaw quicker. Being near a warm fire will thaw items very quickly. 
* Cooking items with the 'Hot' buff will automatically thaw them completely.
* Falling in ice or passing under waterfalls will instantly freeze food items in your backpack, depending on location.
* Sodas that are frozen for more than 6 hours will explode!

## Planned Features

* Frozen food textures
* Cooking time modified by frozen amount
* Weight modified by frozen amount (maybe)
